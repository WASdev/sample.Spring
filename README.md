Spring/SpringMVC v3.2.1 Integration [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.Spring.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.Spring)
==============

This open source integration demonstrates Spring and Spring MVC integration through a simple phonebook sample Web application deployed to Liberty.

This sample demonstrates Spring and Spring MVC integration through a simple phonebook Web application deployed to Liberty.

This sample can be installed onto runtime versions 8.5.5.0 and later.


## Running in Eclipse with Maven

1. Clone this project and import into Eclipse as an 'Existing Maven Project'.
2. Right-click the project and select **Run As > Run on Server**.
3. You should see the following in the console: `Application sample.spring started in XX.XX seconds.`

## Running with Maven

This project can be built with [Apache Maven]. The project uses [Liberty Maven Plug-in] to automatically download and install Liberty with Java EE7 Web Profile runtime from the Maven Central. Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application with Maven:

1. Execute full Maven build. This will cause Liberty Maven Plug-in to download and install Liberty profile server.
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
    ```
    
2. To run the server with the Servlet sample execute:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:run-server
    ```
 
## Running with Gradle

This project can be built with [Apache Gradle]. The project uses [Liberty Gradle Plug-in] to automatically download and install Liberty with Java EE7 Full Platform runtime from [Maven Central]. Liberty Gradle Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application with Gradle:

1. Execute full Gradle build. This will cause Liberty Gradle Plug-in to download and install Liberty profile server.
    ```bash
    $ gradle clean build
    ```

2. To run the server with the JMS application execute:
    ```bash
    $ gradle libertyStart
    ```
        
3. To stop the server with the JMS application execute:
    ```bash
    $ gradle libertyStop
    ```
 

In your browser, enter the URL for the application: [http://localhost:9811/sample.spring/](http://localhost:9811/sample.spring/) (where port 9811 assumes the httpEndpoint provided in the sample server.xml has not been modified).
In your browser, you should see the phone book displayed.
