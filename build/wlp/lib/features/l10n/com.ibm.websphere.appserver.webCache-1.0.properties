description=This feature enables local caching for web responses. It includes the distributedMap feature \
and performs automatic caching of web application responses to improve \
response times and throughput. Applications can include a cache-spec.xml file to customize the \
response caching. The cache may be distributed through addition of a network cache provider such \
as WebSphere eXtreme Scale.
