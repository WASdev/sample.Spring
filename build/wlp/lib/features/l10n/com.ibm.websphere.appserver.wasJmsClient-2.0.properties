description=The wasJmsClient-2.0 feature provides applications with access to the message \
 queues that are hosted on WebSphere Application Server through the JMS 2.0 API. \
 This feature supersedes wasJmsClient-1.1. The wasJmsClient-2.0 feature is compliant \
 with JMS 2.0 specifications and is supported only on JDK 7 or later. It enables access \
 to the messaging engine that is enabled through the wasJmsServer feature, and also to the \
 service integration bus that is hosted on a full profile server.
